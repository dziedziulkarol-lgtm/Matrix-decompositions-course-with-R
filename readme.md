## 📖 Course Overview
This repository contains lecture notes, R scripts, and exercises for a short course (15 hours) on **matrix decompositions**.  
The course combines:

- Linear algebra and matrix analysis  
- Hands-on computations in **R**  
- Applications to data science, image processing, and numerical linear algebra  

The materials are designed both for **mathematics students** and for students of **engineering / computer science** who want to connect theory with practice.
